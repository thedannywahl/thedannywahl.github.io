            <p>When <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/all-features/">OS X 10.10 was released</a> one of the coolest new features was the ability to use your iOS device as an input 'camera' in QuickTime capture.  This feature was a great addition for teachers at <a href="https://tiseagles.com/">Tianjin International School</a> - which had just rolled out its 1:1 iPad program in grades 3-6.  Recording the screen of the iPad allowed the teacher to make demonstrative tutorials for their students.</p>

<p>I was asked to create an example of a screen-captured video, so I figured that I would kill two birds with one stone as another teacher had asked about how to record only a certain part of a screen or to show only a part of a screen.  Instead of telling him how, I decided to create a video demonstrating how to enable, and use Zoom under iOS Accessibility settings.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ymQWahmrvLU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This video was completely unscripted, and actually what you just saw was the 4th or 5th take as I did things like accidentally show my lastpass password or already have zoom enabled in the other takes.</p>
