Crazy things happening right now. You may notice this website looks very broken. Well, that’s just because I’m in the process of moving from a hosted version of WordPress to something a lot more nerdy:

A local [ghost](http://ghost.org/) exported to static HTML via [buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster) (a lá [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) and then pushed to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Until then, this site’s gonna look a little broken, oh well :(
