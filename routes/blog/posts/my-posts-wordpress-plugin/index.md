If you run a multi-author blog you've probably noticed that it's not so easy to find only _your_ posts. "My Posts" fixes that by adding a link under the "Posts" menu that goes directly to a list of posts written by the current user.

My Posts is compatible with WordPress 3.0 and up and works with WPMU and Adminimize. What are you waiting for? Download it now from the WordPress plugins database.
