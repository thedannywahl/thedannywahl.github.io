I love [memrise](http://www.memrise.com/ "memrise"). Not just as a concept or a
webapp, but as a learning tool. I use it daily. But there are a few issues that
I wish they would address that just havenâ€™t been done yet, so I wrote a
Greasemonkey script to fix them.

The main thing this script does is eliminate the need to hover to see garden
items, but there are a couple of other little tweaks in there too. Grab it at
userscripts.org:
