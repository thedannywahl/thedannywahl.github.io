It’s taken a little bit longer than we had hoped but we’re happy to announce that the official 2.7 version of Elegance has been released! It’s currently available in the [Moodle plugins directory](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_elegance).

As with all of our releases we have also opened a new [support thread](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=263376) at the moodle.org forums. Since this is our first release since taking over development of this plugin we were primarily on a “how does this work?” expedition. As such there’s not a lot of new functionality, but there are quite a few bugs that have been fixed.

The two biggest changes in this release are

1.  official Moodle 2.7 compatibility
2.  dependence on moodle-theme\_bootstrap

This is not to be confused with “bootstrapbase” which is included in Moodle 2.7. But, in the effort of easing confusion – if you’re using the Moodle auto-updater (which you should be) you’ll automatically be prompted to install this parent theme first. This also allowed us to lighten the code base- a lot!
