This is just a quick note to say that the next minor version of Elegance is in development. The next release (version 2.7.1) will feature a lot of bug fixes and a couple of new features. If you’d like to follow development you can check the status of the [2.7.1 Milestone over at github](https://github.com/thedannywahl/moodle-theme_elegance/issues?milestone=1&page=1&state=open). It’s already past due by a day- but we had a lot of new issues opened in the last week that we wanted to fix before a new release. In general we do a lot of testing on the weekly+ and master branches of Moodle so we _should_ be able to get a release out the door one week behind a Moodle release.

So what do you need to do to get ready for the next version? I suggest you head over to the [Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/) and make sure you have branding for all your mobile devices.
