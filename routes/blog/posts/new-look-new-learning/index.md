I decided to update (and upgrade) this site and I wanted a few things
specifically: a minimalist look, HTML 5, and CSS 3. Turns out there’s only a few
HTML 5 themes that are what I would consider any good, which probably has less
to do with the general status of HTML 5 development and more to do with WP 3.2.1
being built with HTML 4 rendering by default.

Anyways, I found a theme I liked,
[california](http://themeinspire.com/theme/california-theme/) by
[themeinspire.com](http://themeinspire.com/), unfortunately I found out very
quickly that it’s not WP 3.2 compatible (or possibly earlier) so I’ve decided to
use this theme as my springboard to learning the WP theme engine and HTML 5.

So what you’re looking at now is the master branch of
[California\_4\_WordPress\_3](https://github.com/thedannywahl/California_4_WordPress_3)
hosted at [my github](https://github.com/thedannywahl/). I have a few small
goals for this theme:

1. “valid” HTML 5 & CSS 3
2. WP 3 theme api compliant (including widget areas and custommenu)
3. abstracted functionality via wp-admin page

I think these should be easily achievable, since #1 is basically done already. I
hope to release this in the WP themes repository when done.
