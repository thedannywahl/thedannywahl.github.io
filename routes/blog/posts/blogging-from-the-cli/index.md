I used to blog a lot.  But then I got so wrapped up in the technology that I spent more time fiddling with plugins or CSS or whatever that I didn't end up writing very much content.

I've been a fan of Markdown for a years, it's simple, it's portable, and it allows you to focus on the content, which is great.  But then there's still the whole "front end" thing to worry about.  But what if we tried to make a site that's *mostly* headless.

Well that's what we're doing with [Deno](https://deno.land) and vim.  Check it out!  Create, write, and deploy, all from terminal.
