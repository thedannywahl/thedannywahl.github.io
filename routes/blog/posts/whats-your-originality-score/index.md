We all know anti-plagiarism software. They take a piece of work and then tell
the teacher and the student how original it is. It's a crazy business model.
What's even crazier is that schools fork out the cash for it.

So here's the thing, basically these softwares do a search for you and return a
certainty-based percentage score that tells you how "original" a student's work
is. That's not a very robust feature set for what schools pay for it.

I know the argument is coming about not being able to put a price on academic
integrity and blah blah blah, but here's the thing: In higher ed. plagiarism is
grounds for immediate failure of the class if not expulsion. When's the last
time you expelled a kid, or flunked a kid? Because they're sure as shit
plagiarizing. So what are you paying for then? And there's a good counter-point
to be made which talks about if it's actually bad to plagiarize or not, but I'm
not going there today.

Here's what I want to ask. What's _your_ originality score? You, as a teacher,
or even as an individual. If we took the contents of your course and fed them
into a search engine that could look across all the internet (including other
courses) what percentage would it say is original? Handouts, writing prompts,
science experiments, quiz questions, home work, all of it. And don't tell me
"but standards" because the point of standards is that you have the freedom to
customize the things above as long as they align with the standards.

Put yourself in the shoes of a student as we walk though an imaginary class.

> **Teacher:** Read your textbook _(that I didn't write)_, then download the
> handout _(that I copied off the internet w/o citation)_ from the course _(that
> an instructional designer made for me)_. And don't forget that tomorrow we
> have a quiz _(written by a publisher)_ that includes a reflective essay
> _(which I will assess using canned feedback from the SIS)_.

> **Student:** ...

Doesn't that reek of hypocrisy? At least a little? Yes, teachers gotta teach.
Yes, they're busy because they have 4 preps. Students are busy too; they get
this daily from 5 to 9 different teachers.

The point is: Why aren't we leading by example? If it's okay for us to take
(hopefully legally!) resources that approximate what we wish to express and
rearrange them to suit our purposes, then why can't students? Or, if original
expression is _so_ important that saying _something_ unoriginal is grounds for
expulsion- shouldn't it also be grounds for termination?
