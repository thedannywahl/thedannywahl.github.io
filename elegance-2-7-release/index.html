            <p>It’s taken a little bit longer than we had hoped but we’re happy to announce that the official 2.7 version of Elegance has been released! It’s currently available in the <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_elegance">Moodle plugins directory</a>.</p>

<p>As with all of our releases we have also opened a new <a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=263376">support thread</a> at the moodle.org forums. Since this is our first release since taking over development of this plugin we were primarily on a “how does this work?” expedition. As such there’s not a lot of new functionality, but there are quite a few bugs that have been fixed.</p>

<p>The two biggest changes in this release are </p>

<ol>
<li>official Moodle 2.7 compatibility  </li>
<li>dependence on moodle-theme_bootstrap</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not to be confused with “bootstrapbase” which is included in Moodle 2.7. But, in the effort of easing confusion – if you’re using the Moodle auto-updater (which you should be) you’ll automatically be prompted to install this parent theme first. This also allowed us to lighten the code base- a lot!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thedannywahl/moodle-theme_elegance/compare/7c80461...2.7.0.06">199 changed files with <strong>982</strong> additions and <strong>36,422</strong> deletions</a></p>

<p>Finally we’d like to thank all the <a href="https://github.com/thedannywahl/moodle-theme_elegance/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thedannywahl/moodle-theme_elegance/issues?state=open">bug reporters</a> that helped make this release possible.</p>

<p>Well what are you waiting for? <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_elegance">Go get it</a>!</p>
